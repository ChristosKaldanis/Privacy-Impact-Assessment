# Privacy-Impact-Assessment
# Info

# Project Description
The Privacy-Impact-Assessment Project involves analyzing the impact of physical access to the e-emvolio system by gov.gr using the Privacy Impact Assessment Tool (PIA) by CNIL.

# Methodology
We start with the general framework, which involves a clear picture of the processing of the personal data in question. This is followed by the Fundamental Principles section, which allows us to create the compliance framework for privacy principles. Next, we move on to the Risks section, where we evaluate the risks related to privacy, considering existing or planned measures concerning the security of personal data. Finally, we have the Validation section, where we prepare and formalize the validation of the PIA with a synthetic overview from the previous sections of the software and corresponding graphical representations.

# Implementation
This project was implemented by Christos Kaldanis, an undergraduate student at the Department of Informatics, Ionian University.

# Project Evaluation
The evaluation of this project was excellent, with a rating of 10/10.
